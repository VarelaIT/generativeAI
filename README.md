# Generative AI

## Definitions

Lets difine some terms so we don't scrumble the meaning of this complex subject.

### Artificial intelligence (AI)

* According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence), is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy.

* [BuiltIn.com](https://builtin.com): AI is a wide-ranging branch of computer science that aims to build machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

### Machine Learning (ML)

* According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning), is a branch of AI and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.

### Deep Learning

* According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning), is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.

### Generative AI

* According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generetive-ai), is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content—such as text, images, video, audio or software code—in response to a user’s prompt or request.

    Generative AI relies on sophisticated __machine learning__ models called __deep learning__ models—algorithms that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to understand users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new content.
